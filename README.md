So should it be on your Kindle.

KingsRSS is a GitHub Action-based application that automatically sends RSS feed updates to your Kindle. It has many advantages over other services.

- Free & open-source: KingsRSS uses the Unlicense, which means you can use it freely.
- Low-cost: KingsRSS depends on GitHub Action and email services, which can be both free.
- Without limits: KingsRSS doesn't have a feed number or source limit.
- Community support: KingsRSS is on GitHub; hundreds and I are ready to help you!
