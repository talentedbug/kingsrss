The 900-page tome put together by the Heritage Foundation - a conservative think tank - contains detailed plans for how a second Trump administration will transform the American government and the power of the executive branch.</p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10">We were surrounded by the lights, cameras and microphones that Bannon uses to broadcast for four hours every weekday when he told me he and his show have played a major part in empowering and moblising thousands of Trump-supporting activists, who he called “street fighters”.</p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10">Though he will not be able to lead them from prison, he said that this “Maga army” that “can’t and won’t stop until final victory” will easily continue on its mission.</p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10">After all, he said, the populist Maga movement is greater than him - and even Donald Trump.
